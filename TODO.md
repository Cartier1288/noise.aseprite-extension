# TODO:

Here are some features/fixes/etc. I expect to get to eventually. I would also welcome external
contributions for these if you're interested.

1. Preview options. Preview option on the whole canvas could prove to be too slow, so probably
   a tiny canvas in the dialog menu itself, maybe just `16x16`. Things need to be faster for this to
   work dynamically. Could have a PREVIEW REFRESH button.
2. Option to save noise configurations. Session list of past uses that can be added to persistent 
   list.
3. Save last used _method_ config on next generate + reset to default button.
4. Maybe create a config file / preprocessor that defines the package name and features + UI
   names. The purpose being easy renaming for creating a separate dev package.
5. Link method parameters based on dependency for tiling so that warnings can be issued as well as
   suggested values.
